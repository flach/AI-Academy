<h1 id="artificial-intelligence-is-here...-is-your-business-ready">Artificial Intelligence is here... is your business ready?</h1>
<p>If turning data into knowledge is your business then you urgently need to ask yourself this question. Once merely a dream of artists and scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now really taking off, leading many analysts to call it the <em>fourth industrial revolution</em> after steam, electricity and computers. Before long, AI will be as commonplace in business as IT -- but don't wait for that to happen, as right now <strong>AI can give early adopters a significant competitive advantage</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="sounds-great-but-where-do-i-start">Sounds great, but where do I start?</h2>
<p>The <em>AI Academy</em> can help your business get ready for the AI revolution. We will train your employees to identify the AI opportunities in your organisation today and get started exploiting them tomorrow. Our dedicated and customisable training programmes provide high-level insight in what AI is and can do as well as hands-on experience with exploitable AI solutions. The training programmes can be fine-tuned to the particular data opportunities and knowledge demands that exist in your line of business. Our aim is to <strong>turn your IT specialists into AI specialists</strong>, who can develop practical AI solutions that give you that competitive edge.</p>
<h2 id="so-tell-me-more-about-your-training-programmes...">So tell me more about your training programmes...</h2>
<p>We offer training at three different levels: <em>What</em>, <em>How</em> and <em>Build</em>.</p>
<p><em>What</em> courses explain the basic concepts and techniques of AI in general and non-technical terms, giving participants the ability to assess what AI can achieve in their line of business. The intended audience of <em>What</em> courses includes managers wishing to start their AI journey.</p>
<p><em>How</em> courses go in more technical detail about selected techniques; participants will achieve an understanding of the way specific AI tools obtain their results, and how they can be controlled by the human operator. <em>How</em> courses will be particularly useful for people working with AI tools bought in from external vendors.</p>
<p><em>Build</em> courses explain the workings of selected techniques in detail, allowing participants to implement working AI solutions within their business. <em>Build</em> courses are aimed at IT specialists with programming skills, and would allow companies to migrate from generic AI solutions to an in-house AI platform that is fine-tuned and optimised for their business.</p>
<p>AI requires data and produces knowledge, but data and knowledge occurs in many different forms dependent on the domain of application. <strong>Our courses can therefore be customised to the kinds of data and knowledge that are particularly relevant in your business domain</strong>, be it extracting legal arguments from text documents, identifying exploitable patterns in social network and mobile device data, or mining patent databases.</p>
<h1 id="about-the-ai-academy">About the <em>AI Academy</em></h1>
<p>Noting the widening skills gap in AI and the lack and limitations of more conventional routes to essential training, <strong><a href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~flach/">Professor Peter Flach</a></strong> founded the <em>AI Academy</em> in order to capitalise on his extensive experience and personal network as well as on the latest innovations in technology training. As a Professor at Universities in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and invited lecturer internationally he builds on three decades of experience in teaching machine learning and AI. As an internationally published author of textbooks in AI and machine learning he has reached audiences of tens of thousands in five different languages. As longstanding Editor-in-Chief of <em>Machine Learning</em> published by Springer-Nature he keeps his finger on the pulse of AI and machine learning. As Programme Chair of major international conferences in machine learning and data mining he has significant experience in delivering high-level professional events. Through the <em>AI Academy</em> Peter now exploits his international academic knowledge and expertise to help companies develop practical AI applications.</p>
<p>The mission of the <em>AI Academy</em> is simple: <strong>to provide flexible training and skills development to organisations who wish to expand their AI capability</strong>. The keyword here is <em>flexible</em>: the training programmes we offer can be short and intensive or over longer periods, general and high-level or focussed on your organisational goals and data assets, hands-on and technical or more conceptual. Associated with the <em>AI Academy</em> is an extensive network of AI thought leaders and internationally renowned faculty, each with their own expertise, jointly providing comprehensive coverage of tomorrow's AI landscape.</p>
<p>What sets the <em>AI Academy</em> apart is its <strong>unique domain-driven approach which takes <em>your</em> data assets and <em>your</em> knowledge demands as starting point</strong>. Backed up by years of research on structured data, knowledge representation and intelligent reasoning, the approach ensures that skills and expertise acquired through our training programmes will be directly exploitable in your business domain. We do not believe in panaceas, one-size-fits-all solutions or hammers that make everything look like nails; instead, participants will learn about the entire AI toolbox, how to choose the right tools for the job, and how to fine-tune the tools to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Because of our extensive expertise network and unique domain-driven approach we are confident we can meet your AI training needs. <script type="text/javascript">
