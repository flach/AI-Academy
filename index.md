Artificial Intelligence is here... is your business ready?
--------

If turning data into knowledge is your business then you urgently need to ask yourself this question. Once merely a dream of artists and scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now really taking off, leading many analysts to call it the *fourth industrial revolution* after steam, electricity and computers. Before long, AI will be as commonplace in business as IT -- but don't wait for that to happen, as right now **AI can give early adopters a significant competitive advantage**.

Sounds great, but where do I start?
-----------------------------------

The *AI Academy* can help your business get ready for the AI revolution. We will train your employees to identify the AI opportunities in your organisation today and get started exploiting them tomorrow.

The training programmes can be fine-tuned to the particular data opportunities and knowledge demands that exist in your line of business. Our aim is to **turn your IT specialists into AI specialists**, who can develop practical AI solutions that give you that competitive edge.
