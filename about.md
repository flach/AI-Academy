Noting the widening skills gap in AI and the lack and limitations of more conventional routes to essential training, **[Professor Peter Flach](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~flach/)** founded the *AI Academy* in order to capitalise on his extensive experience and personal network as well as on the latest innovations in technology training. As a Professor at Universities in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and invited lecturer internationally he builds on three decades of experience in teaching machine learning and AI. As an internationally published author of textbooks in AI and machine learning he has reached audiences of tens of thousands in five different languages. As longstanding Editor-in-Chief of *Machine Learning* published by Springer-Nature he keeps his finger on the pulse of AI and machine learning. As Programme Chair of major international conferences in machine learning and data mining he has significant experience in delivering high-level professional events. Through the *AI Academy* Peter now exploits his international academic knowledge and expertise to help companies develop practical AI applications. 

In 2018 **[Dr. Carl Henrik Ek](http://carlhenrik.com)** joined the *AI Academy*. Carl Henrik is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Bristol and has experience teaching at universities in the UK, US and Sweden. As a lecturer he has won several teaching awards and is often invited to give lectures both within and outside the academic community. Carl Henrik's research centres on machine learning: the subfield of AI that is focused on learning from data. 

## Our mission

The mission of the *AI Academy* is simple: **to provide flexible training and skills development to organisations who wish to expand their AI capability**. The keyword here is *flexible*: the training programmes we offer can be short and intensive or over longer periods, general and high-level or focussed on your organisational goals and data assets, hands-on and technical or more conceptual. Associated with the *AI Academy* is an extensive network of AI thought leaders and internationally renowned faculty, each with their own expertise, jointly providing comprehensive coverage of tomorrow's AI landscape. 

What sets the *AI Academy* apart is its **unique domain-driven approach which takes *your* data assets and *your* knowledge demands as starting point**. Backed up by years of research on structured data, knowledge representation and intelligent reasoning, the approach ensures that skills and expertise acquired through our training programmes will be directly exploitable in your business domain. We do not believe in panaceas, one-size-fits-all solutions or hammers that make everything look like nails; instead, participants will learn about the entire AI toolbox, how to choose the right tools for the job, and how to fine-tune the tools to the problem at hand. 

Because of our extensive expertise network and unique domain-driven approach we are confident we can meet your AI training needs. [Get in touch](/contact/) to find out what the *AI Academy* can do to get your business ready for the AI revolution!
