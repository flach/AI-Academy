We offer training at three different levels: *What*, *How* and *Build*.
 
*What* courses explain the basic concepts and techniques of AI in general and non-technical terms, giving participants the ability to assess what AI can achieve in their line of business. The intended audience of *What* courses includes managers wishing to start their AI journey. 

*How* courses go in more technical detail about selected techniques; participants will achieve an understanding of the way specific AI tools obtain their results, and how they can be controlled by the human operator. *How* courses will be particularly useful for people working with AI tools bought in from external vendors. 

*Build* courses explain the workings of selected techniques in detail, allowing participants to implement working AI solutions within their business. *Build* courses are aimed at IT specialists with programming skills, and would allow companies to migrate from generic AI solutions to an in-house AI platform that is fine-tuned and optimised for their business. 

AI requires data and produces knowledge, but data and knowledge occurs in many different forms dependent on the domain of application. **Our courses can therefore be customised to the kinds of data and knowledge that are particularly relevant in your business domain**, be it extracting legal arguments from text documents, identifying exploitable patterns in social network and mobile device data, or mining patent databases.
