<h1>Artificial Intelligence is here… is your business ready?</h1>

<p>If turning data into knowledge is your business then you urgently need to ask yourself this question. Once merely a dream of artists and scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now really taking off, leading many analysts to call it the <em>fourth industrial revolution</em> after steam, electricity and computers. Before long, AI will be as commonplace in business as IT — but don’t wait for that to happen, as right now <strong>AI can give early adopters a significant competitive advantage</strong>. </p>

<h2>Sounds great, but where do I start?</h2>

<p>The <em>AI Academy</em> can help your business get ready for the AI revolution. We will train your employees to identify the AI opportunities in your organisation today and get started exploiting them tomorrow. Our dedicated training programmes provide high-level insight in what AI is and can do as well as hands-on experience with exploitable AI solutions. The training programmes can be fine-tuned to the particular data opportunities and knowledge demands that exist in your line of business. Our aim is to <strong>turn your IT specialists into AI specialists</strong>, who can develop practical AI solutions that give you that competitive edge. </p>

<h2>About the AI Academy</h2>

<p>Noting the widening skills gap in AI and the lack of more conventional routes to essential training, <strong>Professor Peter Flach</strong> founded the <em>AI Academy</em> in order to capitalise on his extensive experience and personal network as well as on the latest innovations in technology training. As a Professor at Universities in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and invited lecturer internationally he builds on three decades of experience in teaching machine learning and AI. As an internationally published author of textbooks in AI and machine learning he has reached audiences of tens of thousands in five different languages. As longstanding Editor-in-Chief of <em>Machine Learning</em> published by Springer-Nature he keeps his finger on the pulse of AI and machine learning. As Programme Chair of major international conferences in machine learning and data mining he has significant experience in delivering high-level professional events.</p>

<p>The mission of the <em>AI Academy</em> is simple: <strong>to provide flexible training and skills development to organisations who wish to expand their AI capability</strong>. The keyword here is <em>flexible</em>: the training programmes we offer can be short and intensive or over longer periods, general and high-level or focussed on your organisational goals and data assets, hands-on and technical or more conceptual. Associated with the <em>AI Academy</em> is an extensive network of AI thought leaders, each with their own expertise, together providing comprehensive coverage of tomorrow’s AI landscape. It is because of this unique expertise network that we are confident to be able to meet your AI training needs.

<h2>My business is ready, we already use a powerful AI platform</h2>

<p>Great! Then we can get you significantly further ahead in your AI journey. Let’s take a concrete example. </p>

<p>Say, your business is in insurance and you have contracted an external vendor who provides an AI-based text-mining platform to analyse insurance policies and claims to help you understand the market and develop competitive new products. In order to adapt this very powerful platform to your IT environment and business processes and keep it operational you send your IT people to regular training courses provided by the vendor. You also have a maintenance contract with the vendor. </p>

<p>Is this the right model for your business? Perhaps — or perhaps not. Ask yourself the following questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>The vendor has many more clients than you and therefore wants to keep the platform generic. Does one size really fit all?</li>
<li>Training courses and maintenance contracts are essential parts of the vendor’s business model. Is the platform really as user-friendly and maintainable as it could be?</li>
<li>Does the functionality really require a single, monolithic system or can many aspects of it be realised independently, using today’s powerful AI and machine learning development tools?</li>
<li>Wouldn’t you prefer your IT people to be trained in applying AI in <em>your business</em> rather than becoming expert users of <em>their platform</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easy to guess how that new startup everybody talks about answers these questions. Luckily you are way ahead of them at the moment, but how confident are you things will remain that way? At the <em>AI Academy</em> we are happy to discuss how our training programmes can help you maintain your advantage. </p>
